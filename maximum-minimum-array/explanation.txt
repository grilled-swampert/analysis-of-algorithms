the min-max algorithm is a technique for finding the smallest and largest elements in an array. 
one approach is to sort the array and then select the first and last elements as the minimum and maximum. 
another approach involves iterating through the array once, comparing each element to the current minimum and maximum, updating them as needed.

iterating through an array once, comparing each element to the current minimum and maximum, and updating them as needed has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. 
this is because each element in the array is visited exactly once. 
the space complexity is O(1), as only a constant amount of extra space is required to store the minimum and maximum values, regardless of the size of the input array.

algorithm:
    1. initialize variables min and max to the first element of the array.
    2. iterate through the array from the second element to the last element.
    3. for each element in the array:
        a. if the element is smaller than the current min, update min to the element.
        b. if the element is larger than the current max, update max to the element.
    4. after iterating through the entire array, min will contain the smallest element and max will contain the largest element.
    5. return min and max as the minimum and maximum values of the array.
