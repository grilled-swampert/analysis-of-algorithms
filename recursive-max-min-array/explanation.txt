the recursive MaxMin is a recursive algorithm that finds the maximum and minimum values within a global array segment defined by indices i and j. 
it uses a divide-and-conquer approach, where the array is split into two halves, and the function is called recursively on each half. 
the maximum and minimum values are updated based on the results of the two halves.

the time complexity of a divide-and-conquer algorithm like this one is typically O(n log n), where n is the number of elements being processed. 
this is because the problem size is halved at each level of recursion, leading to a binary tree of levels log n, and at each level, we perform a linear amount of work proportional to the size of the subproblem. 
however, since the function is designed to find the maximum and minimum in a single pass, the actual time complexity is closer to O(n), as each element is visited exactly once.

the space complexity of this function is O(log n) due to the recursion stack. 
each recursive call adds a new frame to the stack, and the depth of the recursion is log n because the problem size is halved at each level. 
since the function does not use any other data structures that grow with the input size, the space complexity is dominated by the recursion stack.

in summary, the time complexity of the recursiveMaxMin function is O(n), and the space complexity is O(log n).

algorithm: (more like a psuedocode)
    Function recursiveMaxMin(i, j, max, min, count)
        // Base Case: When the array has only one element
        If i equals j Then
            Set max to globalArray[i]
            Set min to globalArray[i]
            Return
        End If

        // Base Case: When the array has two elements
        If i equals (j -  1) Then
            If globalArray[i] is less than globalArray[j] Then
                Set max to globalArray[j]
                Set min to globalArray[i]
            Else
                Set max to globalArray[i]
                Set min to globalArray[j]
            End If
            Return
        End If

        // Recursive Step: Divide the problem into smaller subproblems
        Declare local variables max1, min1
        Calculate mid as the average of i and j
        Increment count by  1
        Call recursiveMaxMin(i, mid, max, min, count)
        Call recursiveMaxMin(mid +  1, j, max1, min1, count)

        // Combine the results from the subproblems
        If max is less than max1 Then
            Set max to max1
        End If
        If min is greater than min1 Then
            Set min to min1
        End If
    End Function
